# Hey üëã, I am Ka Wo

- üßëüèª‚Äçüíª A software engineer with experience in full-stack development, machine learning,
and platform engineering.
- üèÜ A high achiever who works diligently and solves complex problems.
- üìï A lifelong learner, expanding my horizon and helping others grow.

## The Life of Ka Wo

Whenever I meet someone new, they often pause and ask, "How do you pronounce your name?"
I pronounce my name as _"ka-wu"_. In ChineseÔºà**ÂòâÁ¶æ**Ôºâ, my name means **"copious harvest"** üåæ,
a reflection of my belief in high achievement through hard work and determination.

## üïπÔ∏è Gaming

My initial exposure to personal computer came through gaming. When I was little,
I had a strong affinity toward gaming and sports.

After school, I would either play soccer ‚öΩ or basketball üèÄ with my friends.
I was never really good at them, but I enjoyed my camaraderie and playing as a team.

At home, I would play different [Gameboy Advance emulator](https://www.emulatorgames.net/emulators/gameboy-advance/)
games and spend hours perfecting my skills.

> Fun facts: the first games I remembered playing were [Tamagotchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi)
> and [Digivice](https://p-bandai.com/us/item/N2694795001001).

My passion for gaming led me to taking a computer programming class at high school.
During the computer programming class, I learned my first programming language (C++), used my first
IDE ([Turbo C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_C%2B%2B)), and developed multiple [mini-games](https://github.com/kawofong/Cpp-games).


**That year, I decided to become a software engineer.**

## üôåüèª Now

Fast forward to today, I have developed technical expertise and business acumen across numerous
projects:

- At [**Qarik**](https://www.qarik.com/), I led an engineering team to build an AI system
for underwriting loan using AI agents and RAG.
- At [**Vissibl**](https://www.vissibl.ai/), I built AI agents to generate compliance documents
with human-in-the-loop verification and founded their engineering team.
- At [**Google**](https://about.google/company-info/), I built a connected factory solution and
MLOps plugin for their connected product platform on GCP.
- At [**Microsoft**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/), I built solution accelerators for
enterprises to adopt Azure AI services.

Despite my prior experiences, I aspire to further sharpen my competence in building billion-user
products and solving significant challenges. More importantly,
I desire to build a future for my family.

## üö™ Opportunities

I enjoy learning and solving practical problems. If you are looking for advice on how to:

- Use technology to solve a real-world problem and scale efficiently
- Build and lead a high-performing engineering team
- Develop and deploy AI systems with measurable impact
- Create a multi-tenant SaaS service that scales
